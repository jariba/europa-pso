First off, check out the latest version of Europa and build it.

For the moment, there is no makefile to build the PartialPlanWriter
class.  This is in my TODO, but not really important at the moment.
To build the PartialPlanWriter, you must have checked out and built a
reasonably recent version of Europa (cvs co NewPlan; make).  
Execute the following commands (it helps to have put the path to Europa in
the $EUROPA_HOME environment variable and the path to PlanWorks in the
$PLANWORKS_HOME environment variable, unless you don't mind typing the
paths or lots of "../"s):

cd PlanWorks/cpp/integration/europa
g++ -c PartialPlanWriter.cc -I$EUROPA_HOME/Includes -I$EUROPA_HOME/ConstraintNetwork -ggdb3 -Wall

The following modifications must be made to your planner's source to
utilize the PartialPlanWriter:
1) include PartialPlanWriter.hh
2) construct the PartialPlanWriter.  It requires two arguments--a pointer
to the TokenNetwork (so do this after the TokenNetwork is constructed) and
a String containing the destination for output.  My construction line
looks like this:
String dest("./");
PartialPlanWriter *planWriter = new PartialPlanWriter(&tokNet, dest); 
3) everywhere you want the planner to stop and write the output, call
planWriter->write();
For the moment, the only place I do this is right before the return 0 in
simplePlan's main() function.

You also must modify the makefile to include the path to the
PartialPlanWriter's header and object file.  For SimplePlanner, just add
-I$(PLANWORKS_HOME)/cpp/integration/europa
to the DIRFLAG line as well as
$(PLANWORKS_HOME)/cpp/integration/europa/PartialPlanWriter.o
to the OBJECTS line.

Finally, execute
cd $EUROPA_HOME
make simple
and the simplePlan will work as it's supposed to.
