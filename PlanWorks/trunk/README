SUMMARY
=======
Each sequence in the "Planning Sequence" menu now includes the
"Sequence Steps" view, which is a histogram of the partial plan
data base size.

The Token Network View now is freshly layed out after applying a
Content Spec filter.

In all the partial plan views, Mouse-Right on the background offers
"Find Token by Key" which allows the user to enter a token's key and
have the view scroll to the token's location.

BUILDING THE PARTIAL PLAN WRITER
================================

Instructions for building the PartialPlanWriter class are in 
PlanWorks/cpp/integration/europa/README


BUILDING & RUNNING PLANWORKS
============================
If you're running Solaris 8, everything should work right out of
CVS.  Just follow the instructions below.  If you're running Linux, you'll
have to go download the MySQL binary release version 12.20 distrib
4.0.13 for your system
(ftp://mirror.aphix.com/pub/mysql/Downloads/MySQL-Max-4.0/mysql-max-4.0.13-sun-solaris2.8-sparc.tar.gz
for solaris and
ftp://mirror.aphix.com/pub/mysql/Downloads/MySQL-Max-4.0/mysql-max-4.0.13-pc-linux-i686.tar.gz
for linux), un[zip|tar] it, and copy the "mysql", "mysqld", and
"mysqladmin" executables from the bin directory into
PlanWorks/lib/mysql/bin, then follow the instructions below.  If you
are, for whatever reason, not going to use MySQL 4.0.13, then you'll
need to overwrite the files in PlanWorks/lib/mysql/share/mysql/english/
with the files in /path/to/your/mysql/share/mysql/english/.  If you're
on any other system, the above advice still holds, but you're on your own
beyond that.
Alternately, if you have an existing MySQL binary installation and wish to use
that, you can do so by editing build.xml, setting the property
"mysql.custom.bindir" to point to the directory containing the binaries,
then commenting out the line in which the property "mysql.bindir" is set
for your operating system in the chk_[linux|solaris]_2 targets.
If you run 'ant planWorksTest', you have to hit C-c to exit the testing
after it prints its report.  Also, it is strongly recommended that you run
'ant cleanDb' after the tests to make sure the test data is purged from
the database.

> cd PlanWorks

> ant planWorksDbInstall # this sets up the database and must be run before
			 # anything else

> ant # default is to run the application with compilation of all PlanWorks
      # Java source as a dependency.

> ant -projecthelp # lists available targets

 cleanCls           -- delete the 'java/classes' directory tree
 cleanDb            -- delete loaded projects from data base, unless -Dno.clean.db=yes
 compile            -- compile 'java/src' tree into 'java/classes' tree
 hurtPlanWorks      -- Big JFCUnit test (compile, cleandb dependencies)
 planWorks          -- run PlanWorks application (compile dependency)
 planWorksDbInstall -- create all necessary databases and tables
 planWorksProf      -- run PlanWorks with profiling info
 planWorksTest      -- JFCunit test (compile, cleanDb dependencies)

Default target: planWorks

See file "PlanWorks/GETTING_STARTED" for PlanWorks usage.


PREVIOUS MILESTONES
===================
===================

23september03: Milestone 7
==========================
In the Timeline View, clicking Mouse-Right "Set Active Token" on a slot,
will now set the overloaded tokens as "secondary tokens", such that when
Mouse-Right "Snap to Active Token" is invoked in the background of the
Constraint Network View or the Token Network View, these secondary tokens
will be given secondary highlighting (turquoise).  The basic token will
have the primary highlighting color (light green).

The active node ("opened" or "closed" by Mouse-Left click) in the Constraint
Network View, is now positioned in the center of the view after layout.

The key values for tokens, constraints, variables, timelines, and slots now
appear in the appropriate node labels.

The planWorksTest ant target has been improved by adding the following menu
functionalities: "Project->Add Sequence ...", "Project->Delete Sequence ...",
and "Window->Tile Windows".

The PartialPlanWriter previously failed to create certain support
directories.  This is now fixed.

Completed several change requests and bug fixes.

o  GNATS PRs and CRs completed:
   #2056: No test data to add more than one sequence to the same project.
   #2089: Constraint Network View leaves dangling variable node after Content Spec.
   #2090: Need more info from the constraint network display about the actual objects.
   #2091: Graph-redrawing on CNet gets users lost.


18september03: Milestone 6
==========================
File "PlanWorks/GETTING_STARTED" has been added to assist new users.

The sequence directory chooser invoked by "Project->Create ..." and 
"Project->Add Sequence" now supports multiple selection of sequence
directories, by using Ctrl-Mouse-Left for the second and subsequent
selections.  Mouse-left is used for the first selection and Mouse-
Left-Double is used to open directories.  When selection is complete,
click on "OK".

The Temporal Extent View's time scale is now in a separate pane, so
that scrolling the token pane does not lose the time scale.  A
Mouse-Right selection "Set Time Scale Line" has been added.

The Temporal Extent View and  Timeline View are now redrawn after
Content Spec filtering is applied, so as to use screen space more
efficiently.

Each timeline now has a unique color, such that its tokens, in all
views, will have that same color.  In the Constraint Network View,
the variable and constraint nodes associated with a particular token 
will have that token's color.

The "Window" pull-down menu offers screen management with "Tile Windows"
and "Cascade".

Using the Content Specification, it is also possible to limit the set of 
valid tokens to, only free tokens, or only slotted tokens, as well as 
the first token on a slot ("Merge tokens").

Token focus in views has been implemented using Mouse-Right selections
on token or slot nodes to make them "active", and by Mouse-Right selections
on view backgrounds to "snap" the view to the active token.


o  GNATS PRs and CRs completed:
   #2044: Need a minimal getting started guide.
   #2048: In large plans, may lose the time scale with current approach.
   #2049: Project vertical line on clicks for Temporal Extent View.
   #2050: Synchronize focus among views.
   #2051: Need better window management - how about a tiling option?
   #2052: Need to handle redraw on content spec change to use space better.
   #2053: Post error message if trying to add sequence from other project.
   #2055: Bug creating project.
   #2057: Floating data left over filtering timeline view.
   #2058: Timeline color coding incorrect.  
   #2081: Must be able to filter free tokens in the content spec.
   #2082: Need to be able to filter merged Tokens.


05september03: Milestone 5
==========================
Milestone 5 adds the Constraint Network View. Because of its
complexity, initially only the token nodes are displayed.  They
are "opened" by mouse clicks which lay out the token's
variable nodes. Clicking on variable nodes "opens" them to show
or link to their nearest neighbors (constraints or tokens).
Similarly, clicking on constraint nodes "opens" their nearest 
neighbors.  Clicking on an "open" node (bold border), "closes"
that nodes nearest neighbor nodes/links, provided the link counts
are 1.  Then the node becomes "closed" and has an unbold border.

The Temporal Extent View layout has been improved.  The extent line
and associated arrows are displayed immediately below each predicate
node.  Downward arrows are start times, upward arrows are end times,
lefward arrows are -Infinity, and rightward arrows are +Infinity.

Free tokens are now presented in all views.  The automatic expansion
of the four view internal frame windows, now restricts the expansion 
to the size of the enclosing PlanWorks frame.  

The Content Specification processor now filters time intervals, as 
well as predicates and timelines.

Massive performance improvements have been made on database end, often by 
a factor of 4.

The first stage in Europa integration, the PartialPlanWriter is
included.  Instructions for its use are in
PlanWorks/cpp/integration/europa/README.

A new build target, hurtPlanWorks, has been added.  It finds all
directories containing planning sequences under the path pointed to by the
EUROPA_HOME environment variable, opens all available views for each
sequence, validates the views, then deletes the sequence from the
PlanWorks database.

PlanWorks now has a splash screen at startup.  The current image is not
permanent.

GNATS PRs fixed:
   #2011: Temporal extent view is wrong


24july03: Milestone 4 
=====================
Milestone 4 adds the Temporal Extent View.  It also automatically
expands the three view internal frame windows to display their
content, without scrolling.


17july03: Milestone 3 
=====================
Milestone 3 changes the backend data base content from XML accessed by
eXist using XPATH, to MySQL.  This results in a performance improvement 
of at least a factor of 3, and much simpler and quicker data
base queries by the Content Specification processor.  An XML to
MySQL convertor program has been added to convert planGen's XML output
to MySQL files.  The Token Network view has been added.  Project
management is now handled completely in MysQL, rather than using
Java "beans".  The Content Specification processor now filters only
by predicates and timelines.  It will later add time intervals.
o  PRs & CRs completed:
   #1841: Suggestion: group timelines for the same object
          Use alternating colors for grouping
   #1844: Suggestion: consider making interval endpoints immovable
   #1851: Closed View Windows are not restored by Partial Plan->seq->plan->view
   #1990: INSTALLATION: Problems with build.xml under linux


19june03: Milestone 2 
=====================
Milestone 2 integrates the Multiple Document Interface (MDI) for window
management, project management (creating, saving, opening and deleting),
the plan generator, and the Content Specification functionality for 
filtering partial plan rendering in the user selected views, which is 
currently restricted to the Timeline View.


27may03: Milestone 1 
=====================
Milestone 1 includes basic Timeline View, basic eXist XPATH DB
implementation, ant build/startup script, and basic JFCUnit test of 
Timeline View with major deficiencies.
