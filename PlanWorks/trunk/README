SUMMARY
=======
Milestone 3 changes the backend data base content from XML accessed by
eXist using XPATH, to MySQL.  This results in a performance improvement 
of at least a factor of 3, and much simpler and quicker data
base queries by the Content Specification processor.  An XML to
MySQL convertor program has been added to convert planGen's XML output
to MySQL files.  The Token Network view has been added.  Project
management is now handled completely in MysQL, rather than using
Java "beans".  THe Content Specification processor now filters only
by tokens, and predicates.  It will later add time intervals.


CVS CHECKOUT
============
> cvs co -r PW_M_3 PlanWorks


PREREQUISITES
=============
Set environment varibles:
  o JAVA_HOME - location of J2SDK >= 1.4.1
    e.g. setenv JAVA_HOME /home/wtaylor/pub/j2sdk1.4.1_02

  o ANT_HOME - location of Apache Ant 
    e.g. setenv ANT_HOME <root>/PlanWorks/java/lib/apache-ant

  o PATH - should include Ant 
    e.g. tcsh: set path = ($path <root>/PlanWorks/java/lib/apache-ant/bin)

  o OSTYPE - linux, solaris, or darwin (MacOS)
    should be set by user's standard environment

  o USER - user's account name, used in defining the data base collection
    should be set by user's standard environment


BUILDING & RUNNING PLANWORKS
============================
If you're running Solaris 8, everything should work right out of
CVS.  Just follow the instructions below.  If you're running Linux, you'll
have to go download the MySQL binary release for your system
(http://www.mysql.com/downloads/mysql-4.0.html), un[zip|tar] it, and copy
the "mysql", "mysqld", and "mysqladmin" executables from the
bin directory into PlanWorks/lib/mysql/bin, then follow
the instructions below.  If you're on any other system, the above advice
still holds, but you're on your own beyond that.

> cd PlanWorks

> ant planWorksDbInstall #this sets up the database and must be run before
			 #anything else

> ant # default is to run the application with compilation of all PlanWorks
      # Java source as a dependency.

> ant -projecthelp # lists available targets

 cleanCls          -- delete the 'java/classes' directory tree
 cleanDb           -- delete loaded projects from data base, unless -Dno.clean.db=yes
 compile           -- compile 'java/src' tree into 'java/classes' tree
 planWorks         -- run PlanWorks application (compile dependency)
 planWorksProf     -- run PlanWorks with profiling info
 planWorksTest     -- JFCunit test (compile, cleanDb dependencies)

Default target: planWorks


PREVIOUS MILESTONES
===================
19june03: Milestone 2 integrates the Multiple Document Interface (MDI) for window
management, project management (creating, saving, opening and deleting),
the plan generator, and the Content Specification functionality for 
filtering partial plan rendering in the user selected views, which is 
currently restricted to the Timeline View.

27may03: Milestone 1 includes basic Timeline View, basic eXist XPATH DB
implementation, ant build/startup script, and basic JFCUnit test of 
Timeline View with major deficiencies.


DEVELOPING PLANWORKS
====================
Supports Emacs/XEmacs with JDE integrated development environment
http://jde.sunsite.dk/    # version 2.3.2

Additional Required environment varibles:
  o JDE_HOME - location of JDE 
    e.g. setenv JDE_HOME /home/wtaylor/pub/jde/jde-2.3.2
  o PLANWORKS_ROOT - directory pathname of this file
    e.g. setenv PLANWORKS_ROOT /home/wtaylor/PlanWorksProject/PlanWorks

used by PlanWorks/java/prj.el -- JDE configuration file

Other files used by  Emacs/XEmacs/JDE:
  PlanWorks/java/build-tags-file.csh
  PlanWorks/java/planWorks.TAGS
