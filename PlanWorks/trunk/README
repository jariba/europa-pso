SUMMARY
=======
o Improved diagnostics for "Invalid Sequence Directory" error dialog.
o The "Find Transaction by Obj_Key" Mouse-right popup selection and
  the transaction entry column "OBJ_KEY", have now been properly
  restricted to the partial plan Transaction View, the "Steps"
  Sequence Query for "Where ..." queries with blank "Key" entries and
  "With ..." queries, and the "Transactions" Sequence Query for
  "In Range ..." queries.  The OBJ_KEY" value found using
  "Find Transaction by Obj_Key" is now highlighted.
o The Temporal Extent View now has an additional Mouse-Right selection:
  "Hide/Show Node Labels".  These node labels are now aligned with
  the earliest start times.
o The Content Spec dialog has been renamed Content Filter.
o The "window bar" buttons at the bottom of the DeskTop Frame have been
  removed.  Use the "Window" pull-down menu.
o The Constraint Network View's variable node tool tips have been
  augmented to show the PARAMETER_VAR names and OBJECT_VAR names.
o The Sequence Query dialog now has two new options: "Free Tokens At Step" 
  and "Unbound Variables At Step".

o  GNATS PRs and CRs completed:
   #2190: Align boxes in Temporal extent view with earliest start.
   #2194: Rename Content Specification to Content Filter.
   #2199: Provide actual parameter names.
   #2193: Provide stepping forward and backward capability for all views.

CVS CHECKOUT
============
> cvs co -r PW_M_11 PlanWorks


PREREQUISITES
=============
Set environment varibles:
  o JAVA_HOME - location of J2SDK >= 1.4.1
    On Solaris (Code IC)
      setenv JAVA_HOME /usr/local/j2sdk1.4.1
    On Linux, e.g.
      setenv JAVA_HOME /home/wtaylor/pub/j2sdk1.4.1_02
    On MacOSX, in terminal window
      setenv JAVA_HOME /usr
      or, put this statement in
      $HOME/.MACOSX/env.plist

  o ANT_HOME - location of Apache Ant 
    e.g. setenv ANT_HOME <root>/PlanWorks/java/lib/apache-ant

  o PATH - should include Ant 
    e.g. tcsh: set path = ($path <root>/PlanWorks/java/lib/apache-ant/bin)

  o OSTYPE - linux, solaris, or darwin (MacOS)
    Should be set by user's standard environment

  o USER - user's account name, used in defining the data base collection
    Should be set by user's standard environment

  o EUROPA_HOME - path to the root Europa directory
    e.g. setenv EUROPA_HOME ~/NewPlan


OPTIONAL CONFIGURATION
======================
o The default value for the maximum memory required by the Java Virtual Machine
  is 200 mega-bytes.  It is posible to set it to a much higher value, but only
  to this one particular value (Ant is reponsible for this restriction):

  > setenv JVM_GC_MAX 975

o PlanWorks starts up without any default project name or default sequence
  directory.  To specify such, go to PlanWorks/build.xml:

  <!-- specify values for the next two properties to have PlanWorks have a default project -->
  <property name="default.project.name" value=""/>
  <property name="default.sequence.dir" value=""/>


BUILDING THE PARTIAL PLAN WRITER
================================

Instructions for building the PartialPlanWriter class are in 
PlanWorks/cpp/integration/europa/README


BUILDING & RUNNING PLANWORKS
============================
If you're running Solaris 8, everything should work right out of
CVS.  Just follow the instructions below.  If you're running Linux, you'll
have to go download the MySQL binary release version 12.20 distrib
4.0.13 for your system
(ftp://mirror.aphix.com/pub/mysql/Downloads/MySQL-Max-4.0/mysql-max-4.0.13-sun-solaris2.8-sparc.tar.gz
for solaris and
ftp://mirror.aphix.com/pub/mysql/Downloads/MySQL-Max-4.0/mysql-max-4.0.13-pc-linux-i686.tar.gz
for linux), un[zip|tar] it, and copy the "mysql", "mysqld", and
"mysqladmin" executables from the bin directory into
PlanWorks/lib/mysql/bin, then follow the instructions below.  If you
are, for whatever reason, not going to use MySQL 4.0.13, then you'll
need to overwrite the files in PlanWorks/lib/mysql/share/mysql/english/
with the files in /path/to/your/mysql/share/mysql/english/.  If you're
on any other system, the above advice still holds, but you're on your own
beyond that.
Alternately, if you have an existing MySQL binary installation and wish to use
that, you can do so by editing build.xml, setting the property
"mysql.custom.bindir" to point to the directory containing the binaries,
then commenting out the line in which the property "mysql.bindir" is set
for your operating system in the chk_[linux|solaris]_2 targets.
If you run 'ant planWorksTest', you have to hit C-c to exit the testing
after it prints its report.  Also, it is strongly recommended that you run
'ant cleanDb' after the tests to make sure the test data is purged from
the database.

> cd PlanWorks

> ant planWorksDbInstall # this sets up the database and must be run before
			 # anything else

> ant # default is to run the application with compilation of all PlanWorks
      # Java source as a dependency.

> ant -projecthelp # lists available targets

 cleanCls           -- delete the 'java/classes' directory tree
 cleanDb            -- delete loaded projects from data base, unless -Dno.clean.db=yes
 compile            -- compile 'java/src' tree into 'java/classes' tree
 planWorks          -- run PlanWorks application (compile dependency)
 planWorksDbInstall -- create all necessary databases and tables
 planWorksProf      -- run PlanWorks with profiling info
 test               -- Data access layer JFCUnit test (compile, cleandb dependencies)

Default target: planWorks

See file "PlanWorks/GETTING_STARTED" for PlanWorks usage.
See file "PlanWorks/testCases/planViz.txt" for testing use cases.


PREVIOUS MILESTONES
===================
===================

21november03: Milestone 10
==========================
o Sequence Steps windows are now closeable.
o Query Results windows are now maximizable.
o If the Content Spec window is iconified using the icon in the window's
  title bar, and the user selects Mouse-Right "Raise Content Spec", the
   Content Spec window is de-iconified and given focus.
o Partial Plan view's Mouse-Right selection "Open a View" no longer
  creates a seconday menu of views.  The available views are added
  "in-line" to the primary menu.
o Partial Plan view's Mouse-Right selections of views to open no longer
  includes the current view.
o The Content Spec window's background areas now offer Mouse-Right
  selections for opening individual or all partial plan views.
o The Sequence Query dialog for "Steps" queries now accepts an empty
  key slot, which will return the steps for all keys for the specified 
  contraint, token, or variable transaction type.
o The Sequence Query dialog no longer requires the use of the "Reset Query"
  button between successive queries.
o The object key values displayed in the Timeline view are now specified as
  to type: timeline, slot, and token.  The token key(s) are displayed as
  the second line of the slot node tooltip.
o Slotted tokens in all partial plan views, except for Transaction view,
  have a tooltip with a second line which displays their slot key value.
o Clicking on the "Apply Spec" and "Reset Spec" buttons of the Content
  Spec dialog cause the Constraint Network view to displayed with a
  fresh layout.
o The "Step" column values of Query Results windows for "Steps" and 
  "Transactions" queries, now offer a Mouse-Right popup with actions
  on the partial plan views for that step.
o The partial plan views, except for Transaction View, and the Sequence
  Steps View, now have a Mouse-Right popup named "Overview Window" which
  opens a 1/8th scaled view of the entire "observed" view.  There is a
  rectangle in the overview which can be dragged to cause the "observed" 
  view to be scrolled to new locations.  Mouse-Left clicking in the
  overview outside of the rectangle will cause the "observed" view to
  "jump" to that location.

o  GNATS PRs and CRs completed:
   #2172: Invalid behaviour for sequence windows after closing and opening.


07november03: Milestone 9
=========================
The "Planning Sequence" menu now expands only into the available
sequence names.  Selecting a sequence name brings up two windows.
The first, "SequenceQuery ...", allows the user to make data base
queries over the sequence.  The second, the "SequenceStepsView",
is a histogram of the partial plan data base size for each step.  
Individual or all partial plan views for each step are available 
by clicking Mouse-Right on the desired step in the histogram.

The "SequenceQuery ..." dialog provides the user with queries which
are in two groups, based on the primary kind of information returned.  
"Steps": "Where Constraint/Token/Variable Transacted ..." which asks 
for a key value and the transaction type; "With Non-unit Variable 
Decisions", "With Restrictions", and "With Unit Variable Decisions".  
"Transactions": "For Constraint/Token/Variable ..." which asks for a key 
value; and "In Range ...", which asks for "StartStep" and "EndStep" values.
The query results are displayed in windows entitled "QueryResults for ...".
The query results windows can be removing by clicking Mouse-Right on 
the background of the "SequenceQuery ..." dialog, and selecting
"Discard Query Results Windows".

For each plan sequence step, there is now an additional partial plan
view: "Transaction View".  It displays the transactions for the step.

Both the partial plan "Transaction View" windows , and the sequence query
"Query Results for ..." windows for "Transactions" queries, and the
"With ..." "Steps" queries offer the user a pop-up dialog entitled 
"Find Transaction by Obj_Key".  Mouse-Right on the background of the 
header section of the window brings up this dialog.

The column header nodes of the "Transaction View", and "Query Results for ..."
windows, offer sorting of that columns's values, alternately in
ascending order and descending order.

All partial plan view's  Mouse-Right pop-ups offer the user a second
pop-up selection ("Open a View") of the other partial plan views, 
which will create them as needed.  All views, except for Transaction View,
also offer "Raise Content Spec", which will set focus on the appropriate
partial plan Content Spec window.

In addition, all partial plan view's  Mouse-Right pop-ups offer the user
"Close All Views", "Hide All Views", and "Open All Views".

Each partial plan view, except for Transaction View, had a Mouse-Right
choice of "Find Token By Key".  This has been changed and generalized to
"Find By Key".  For Temporal Extent and Token Network views, entered keys
will find token nodes; for the Timeline view, entered keys will find 
token and slot nodes; and for the Constraint Network view, entered keys
will find find token, variable, and constraint nodes -- opening
appropriate connecting nodes, if needed.

The Constraint Network View now uses a new layout algorithm that is many
times faster than the previous algorithm.  Layout now generally takes 
< 300ms.

Almost all loading of data into the database is deferred until absolutely
necessary.  This adds slight overhead to the first time a Partial Plan is
viewed, but is a one-time cost.

The current PartialPlanWriter (PlanWorks/cpp/integration/europa/README)
requires a recent version of EUROPA.  The earliest known working
version is tagged with the PlanWorks milestone release tag PW_M_9.  

The PartialPlanWriter has changed since PW_M_8, and must be rebuilt.

o  GNATS PRs and CRs completed:
   #2150: Constraint Network View: find constraint/variable nodes by key.
   #2157: Add window choices on pop-up menu for within Partial Plan.
   #2158: Need to greatly imporve load-times for sequences.
   #2159: Change option to Find By Key instead of Find Token By Key.
   #2160: Time to delete a sequence is way too long   
   #2161: Project menu goes away after deleting a sequence.


16october03: Milestone 8
========================
Each sequence in the "Planning Sequence" menu now includes only the
"Sequence Steps" view, which is a histogram of the partial plan
data base size for each step.  The sequence step menu selections have
been removed.  Partial plan views for each step are now available
by clicking Mouse-Right on the desired step in the histogram
("SequenceStepsView").  The histogram steps have a "mouse over" pop-up 
showing the step number, the data base size, and the number of
transactions.

The Token Network View now is freshly layed out after applying a
Content Spec filter.

In all the partial plan views, Mouse-Right on the background offers
"Find Token by Key" which allows the user to enter a token's key and
have the view scroll to that token's location.

The Partial Plan Content Spec has been enhanced to handle token keys.
Click on either the "require" or "exclude" radio button, and then enter
the key value in the input slot.  To include more keys, click on "Add";
to remove keys from a previous "Apply Spec" set, click on "Remove".
The "require" or "exclude" selections override the "Predicate",
"Timeline", and "Time Interval" selections, with applied together.

Test use cases have been defined to replace the "planWorksTest" JFCUnit 
test which had become unusable.  A new unit test for the PlanWorks
data access layer is now in its place and can be run with 
"ant test".

The current PartialPlanWriter (PlanWorks/cpp/integration/europa/README)
requires a recent version of EUROPA.  The earliest known working
version is tagged with the PlanWorks milestone release tag PW_M_8.  
Note: Registering the PartialPlanWriter as a subscriber in
simplePlan.cc breaks EUROPA's make tests.  This is being worked
on.  

Please note that the current database model invalidates all old
data and will require a rebuilding of the database tables 
("ant planWorksDbInstall").

o  GNATS PRs and CRs completed:
   #2079: Users not telepathic-need to specify MySQL version.
   #2086: PlanWriter writes output files in wierd places.
   #2092: The filter of free token, etc from the content spec should 
          persist between window open and closes.
   #2107: Issues with display of Token Network and other windows.
   #2108: Changes in Token Network View.


23september03: Milestone 7
==========================
In the Timeline View, clicking Mouse-Right "Set Active Token" on a slot,
will now set the overloaded tokens as "secondary tokens", such that when
Mouse-Right "Snap to Active Token" is invoked in the background of the
Constraint Network View or the Token Network View, these secondary tokens
will be given secondary highlighting (turquoise).  The basic token will
have the primary highlighting color (light green).

The active node ("opened" or "closed" by Mouse-Left click) in the Constraint
Network View, is now positioned in the center of the view after layout.

The key values for tokens, constraints, variables, timelines, and slots now
appear in the appropriate node labels.

The planWorksTest ant target has been improved by adding the following menu
functionalities: "Project->Add Sequence ...", "Project->Delete Sequence ...",
and "Window->Tile Windows".

The PartialPlanWriter previously failed to create certain support
directories.  This is now fixed.

Completed several change requests and bug fixes.

o  GNATS PRs and CRs completed:
   #2056: No test data to add more than one sequence to the same project.
   #2089: Constraint Network View leaves dangling variable node after Content Spec.
   #2090: Need more info from the constraint network display about the actual objects.
   #2091: Graph-redrawing on CNet gets users lost.


18september03: Milestone 6
==========================
File "PlanWorks/GETTING_STARTED" has been added to assist new users.

The sequence directory chooser invoked by "Project->Create ..." and 
"Project->Add Sequence" now supports multiple selection of sequence
directories, by using Ctrl-Mouse-Left for the second and subsequent
selections.  Mouse-left is used for the first selection and Mouse-
Left-Double is used to open directories.  When selection is complete,
click on "OK".

The Temporal Extent View's time scale is now in a separate pane, so
that scrolling the token pane does not lose the time scale.  A
Mouse-Right selection "Set Time Scale Line" has been added.

The Temporal Extent View and  Timeline View are now redrawn after
Content Spec filtering is applied, so as to use screen space more
efficiently.

Each timeline now has a unique color, such that its tokens, in all
views, will have that same color.  In the Constraint Network View,
the variable and constraint nodes associated with a particular token 
will have that token's color.

The "Window" pull-down menu offers screen management with "Tile Windows"
and "Cascade".

Using the Content Specification, it is also possible to limit the set of 
valid tokens to, only free tokens, or only slotted tokens, as well as 
the first token on a slot ("Merge tokens").

Token focus in views has been implemented using Mouse-Right selections
on token or slot nodes to make them "active", and by Mouse-Right selections
on view backgrounds to "snap" the view to the active token.


o  GNATS PRs and CRs completed:
   #2044: Need a minimal getting started guide.
   #2048: In large plans, may lose the time scale with current approach.
   #2049: Project vertical line on clicks for Temporal Extent View.
   #2050: Synchronize focus among views.
   #2051: Need better window management - how about a tiling option?
   #2052: Need to handle redraw on content spec change to use space better.
   #2053: Post error message if trying to add sequence from other project.
   #2055: Bug creating project.
   #2057: Floating data left over filtering timeline view.
   #2058: Timeline color coding incorrect.  
   #2081: Must be able to filter free tokens in the content spec.
   #2082: Need to be able to filter merged Tokens.


05september03: Milestone 5
==========================
Milestone 5 adds the Constraint Network View. Because of its
complexity, initially only the token nodes are displayed.  They
are "opened" by mouse clicks which lay out the token's
variable nodes. Clicking on variable nodes "opens" them to show
or link to their nearest neighbors (constraints or tokens).
Similarly, clicking on constraint nodes "opens" their nearest 
neighbors.  Clicking on an "open" node (bold border), "closes"
that nodes nearest neighbor nodes/links, provided the link counts
are 1.  Then the node becomes "closed" and has an unbold border.

The Temporal Extent View layout has been improved.  The extent line
and associated arrows are displayed immediately below each predicate
node.  Downward arrows are start times, upward arrows are end times,
lefward arrows are -Infinity, and rightward arrows are +Infinity.

Free tokens are now presented in all views.  The automatic expansion
of the four view internal frame windows, now restricts the expansion 
to the size of the enclosing PlanWorks frame.  

The Content Specification processor now filters time intervals, as 
well as predicates and timelines.

Massive performance improvements have been made on database end, often by 
a factor of 4.

The first stage in Europa integration, the PartialPlanWriter is
included.  Instructions for its use are in
PlanWorks/cpp/integration/europa/README.

A new build target, hurtPlanWorks, has been added.  It finds all
directories containing planning sequences under the path pointed to by the
EUROPA_HOME environment variable, opens all available views for each
sequence, validates the views, then deletes the sequence from the
PlanWorks database.

PlanWorks now has a splash screen at startup.  The current image is not
permanent.

GNATS PRs fixed:
   #2011: Temporal extent view is wrong


24july03: Milestone 4 
=====================
Milestone 4 adds the Temporal Extent View.  It also automatically
expands the three view internal frame windows to display their
content, without scrolling.


17july03: Milestone 3 
=====================
Milestone 3 changes the backend data base content from XML accessed by
eXist using XPATH, to MySQL.  This results in a performance improvement 
of at least a factor of 3, and much simpler and quicker data
base queries by the Content Specification processor.  An XML to
MySQL convertor program has been added to convert planGen's XML output
to MySQL files.  The Token Network view has been added.  Project
management is now handled completely in MysQL, rather than using
Java "beans".  The Content Specification processor now filters only
by predicates and timelines.  It will later add time intervals.
o  PRs & CRs completed:
   #1841: Suggestion: group timelines for the same object
          Use alternating colors for grouping
   #1844: Suggestion: consider making interval endpoints immovable
   #1851: Closed View Windows are not restored by Partial Plan->seq->plan->view
   #1990: INSTALLATION: Problems with build.xml under linux


19june03: Milestone 2 
=====================
Milestone 2 integrates the Multiple Document Interface (MDI) for window
management, project management (creating, saving, opening and deleting),
the plan generator, and the Content Specification functionality for 
filtering partial plan rendering in the user selected views, which is 
currently restricted to the Timeline View.


27may03: Milestone 1 
=====================
Milestone 1 includes basic Timeline View, basic eXist XPATH DB
implementation, ant build/startup script, and basic JFCUnit test of 
Timeline View with major deficiencies.
