SUMMARY
=======
Milestone 5 adds the Constraint Network View. Because of its
complexity, initially only the token nodes are displayed.  They
are mouse clickable: left, display and layout the token's
variable and constraint nodes; right, remove the token's
variable and constraint nodes.  The automatic expansion of the 
four view internal frame windows, now restricts the expansion
to the size of the enclosing PlanWorks frame.  The Content
Specification processor now filters time intervals, as well as
tokens, and predicates.  

PRs fixed:
o #2011: Temporal extent view is wrong


CVS CHECKOUT
============
> cvs co -r PW_M_5 PlanWorks


PREREQUISITES
=============
Set environment varibles:
  o JAVA_HOME - location of J2SDK >= 1.4.1
    On Solaris (Code IC)
      setenv JAVA_HOME /usr/local/j2sdk1.4.1
    On Linux, e.g.
      setenv JAVA_HOME /home/wtaylor/pub/j2sdk1.4.1_02
    On MacOSX, in terminal window
      setenv JAVA_HOME /usr
      or, put this statement in
      $HOME/.MACOSX/env.plist

  o ANT_HOME - location of Apache Ant 
    e.g. setenv ANT_HOME <root>/PlanWorks/java/lib/apache-ant

  o PATH - should include Ant 
    e.g. tcsh: set path = ($path <root>/PlanWorks/java/lib/apache-ant/bin)

  o OSTYPE - linux, solaris, or darwin (MacOS)
    should be set by user's standard environment

  o USER - user's account name, used in defining the data base collection
    should be set by user's standard environment


BUILDING & RUNNING PLANWORKS
============================
If you're running Solaris 8, everything should work right out of
CVS.  Just follow the instructions below.  If you're running Linux, you'll
have to go download the MySQL binary release for your system
(http://www.mysql.com/downloads/mysql-4.0.html), un[zip|tar] it, and copy
the "mysql", "mysqld", and "mysqladmin" executables from the
bin directory into PlanWorks/lib/mysql/bin, then follow
the instructions below.  If you're on any other system, the above advice
still holds, but you're on your own beyond that.
If you run 'ant planWorksTest', you have to hit C-c to exit the testing
after it prints its report.  Also, it is strongly recommended that you run
'ant cleanDb' after the tests to make sure the test data is purged from
the database.

> cd PlanWorks

> ant planWorksDbInstall #this sets up the database and must be run before
			 #anything else

> ant # default is to run the application with compilation of all PlanWorks
      # Java source as a dependency.

> ant -projecthelp # lists available targets

 cleanCls          -- delete the 'java/classes' directory tree
 cleanDb           -- delete loaded projects from data base, unless -Dno.clean.db=yes
 compile           -- compile 'java/src' tree into 'java/classes' tree
 planWorks         -- run PlanWorks application (compile dependency)
 planWorksProf     -- run PlanWorks with profiling info
 planWorksTest     -- JFCunit test (compile, cleanDb dependencies)

Default target: planWorks


PREVIOUS MILESTONES
===================
24july 03:Milestone 4 adds the Temporal Extent View.  It also automatically
expands the three view internal frame windows to display their
content, without scrolling.

17july03: Milestone 3 changes the backend data base content from XML accessed by
eXist using XPATH, to MySQL.  This results in a performance improvement 
of at least a factor of 3, and much simpler and quicker data
base queries by the Content Specification processor.  An XML to
MySQL convertor program has been added to convert planGen's XML output
to MySQL files.  The Token Network view has been added.  Project
management is now handled completely in MysQL, rather than using
Java "beans".  The Content Specification processor now filters only
by tokens, and predicates.  It will later add time intervals.

19june03: Milestone 2 integrates the Multiple Document Interface (MDI) for window
management, project management (creating, saving, opening and deleting),
the plan generator, and the Content Specification functionality for 
filtering partial plan rendering in the user selected views, which is 
currently restricted to the Timeline View.

27may03: Milestone 1 includes basic Timeline View, basic eXist XPATH DB
implementation, ant build/startup script, and basic JFCUnit test of 
Timeline View with major deficiencies.


DEVELOPING PLANWORKS
====================
Supports Emacs/XEmacs with JDE integrated development environment
http://jde.sunsite.dk/    # version 2.3.2

Additional Required environment varibles:
  o JDE_HOME - location of JDE 
    e.g. setenv JDE_HOME /home/wtaylor/pub/jde/jde-2.3.2
  o PLANWORKS_ROOT - directory pathname of this file
    e.g. setenv PLANWORKS_ROOT /home/wtaylor/PlanWorksProject/PlanWorks

used by PlanWorks/java/prj.el -- JDE configuration file

Other files used by  Emacs/XEmacs/JDE:
  PlanWorks/java/build-tags-file.csh
  PlanWorks/java/planWorks.TAGS


PRs & CRs completed for PW_M_3
