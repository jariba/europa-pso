 cleanCls          -- delete the 'java/classes' directory tree
 cleanDb           -- delete loaded projects from data base, unless -Dno.clean.db=yes
 compile           -- compile 'java/src' tree into 'java/classes' tree
 existTest         -- prototyping test (compile, cleanDb dependencies)
 planWorks         -- run PlanWorks application (compile dependency)
 planWorksProf     -- run PlanWorks with profiling info
 timelineViewTest  -- JFCunit test (compile, cleanDb dependencies)

Default target: planWorks
