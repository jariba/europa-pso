Projects and Plan Sequences
===========================

"Project->Create ..." brings up the "Create Project" dialog requesting
a project name.  The default is "monkey", which is an embedded test plan.

Clicking "OK" on the "Create Project" dialog brings up the "Select Sequence 
Directory of Partial Plan Directory(ies)" chooser.  The sequence directory 
chooser (also invoked by "Project->Add Sequence") supports multiple 
selection of sequence directories, by using Ctrl-Mouse-Left for the second 
and subsequent selections.  Mouse-left is used for the first selection and 
Mouse-Left-Double is used to open directories.  When selection is complete,
click on "OK".  The selected sequence(s) are then loaded into the MySQL
data base.  Pull-down menu "Planning Sequence" will be created, which is a 
cascading menu of "sequence names", then "partial plan names", and then 
"partial plan views".

"Project->Open ..." will bring up pre-loaded plan sequences for a pre-
defined project, and allow them the be viewed using the "Planning
Sequence" cascading menu.

"Project-Delete ..." will remove a pre-loaded project and its sequences
from view (if being currently displayed), and from the MySQL data base.

"Project->Add Sequence" prompts the user, via the sequence chooser dialog,
to add one or more sequences to the current project, and the MySQL data
base.

"Project->Delete Sequence" prompts the user, via a list dialog, to remove
the selected sequence from the current project, and the MySQL data base.

Plan Sequence Views
===================

The "Planning Sequence" cascading menu allows the user to select the 
sequence, the partial plan, and the plan view to be displayed.  There are 
four active views:

Constraint Network View
-----------------------
An incrementally built directed graph of tokens, variables, and constraints.
Because of its complexity, initially only the token nodes are displayed.  
They are "opened" by mouse clicks which lay out the token's variable nodes. 
Clicking on variable nodes "opens" them to show or link to their nearest 
neighbors (constraints or tokens).  Similarly, clicking on constraint nodes 
"opens" their nearest neighbors.  Clicking on an "open" node (bold border), 
"closes" that nodes nearest neighbor nodes/links, provided the link counts
are 1.  Then the node becomes "closed" and has an unbold border.

Temporal Extent View
--------------------
Lays out all predicates on a time scale, with triangles denoting the start 
and end variable values.  The range of extent is shown by a horizontal line.
The extent line and associated triangles are displayed immediately below 
each predicate node.  Downward triangles are start times, upward triangles 
are end times, leftward triangles are -Infinity, and rightward triangles are 
+Infinity.  Clicking Mouse-Right on the view background will popup a menu,
one of whose selections is "Set Time Scale Line".  Selecting it will cause a
red vertical time scale line to be drawn.  A Mouse-Right "Set Time Scale Line"
selection at another location will move the time scale line.  Applying a 
Content Specification filter will cause the view to be redrawn with only the 
filtered predicates.

Timeline View
-------------
Lays out the plan's objects, timelines, and slots.  Start/end time intervals
are displayed at slot boundaries.  Applying a Content Specification filter 
will cause the view to be redrawn with only the filtered timelines and slots.
Adjacent slots whose end and start intervals are equal will be drawn abutting 
each other.  Those that are not, will be drawn with a fixed space between them,
and the later slot will have its time interval labels drawn "lower" than
the previous slot, to prevent overlap.

Token Network View
------------------
Lays out the plan's token relations in directed graphs whose root nodes
are the "supreme" master tokens.


Token Focus in Views
====================
Token nodes (slot nodes in the Timeline View) in all views, have a
Mouse-Right popup menu with the possible selection: "Set Active Token".
When the "active token" has been set, the other views have a
"background" Mouse-Right popup menu with the possible selection of
"Snap to Active Token".  Making this selection will cause the view
to scroll to a position where the "active token" will be shown,
highlighted, in the approximate center of the view.  A Mouse-Left click
in any view will erase node selection highlighting.


Content Specification
=====================

The information displayed in the partial plan views may be filtered by
predicate, by timeline, and by time interval using the partial plan's
Content Specification dialog.  It is also possible to limit the
set of valid tokens to only free or slotted tokens, as well as 
the first token on a slot.  Selections applied from this dialog
result, internally, in a set of valid tokens, which are used by the 
views to filter their displays.


Screen Management
=================

The "Window" pull-down menu offers the user the ability to rearrange the
partial plan content spec and view internal windows by horizontal "tiling", 
vertical "tiling", or "cascading".  This menu also provides for the 
selection of all active windows.

Note that the Multiple Document Interface (MDI) implementation presents
the user with a line of click-able icons along the bottom of the PlanWorks
frame for all internal windows.
