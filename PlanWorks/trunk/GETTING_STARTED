Projects and Plan Sequences
===========================
"Project->Create ..." brings up the "Create Project" dialog requesting
a project name.  The default is "monkey", which is an embedded test plan.

Clicking "OK" on the "Create Project" dialog brings up the "Select Sequence 
Directory of Partial Plan Directory(ies)" chooser.  The sequence directory 
chooser (also invoked by "Project->Add Sequence") supports multiple 
selection of sequence directories, by using Ctrl-Mouse-Left for the second 
and subsequent selections.  Mouse-left is used for the fir selection and 
Mouse-Left-Double is used to open directories.  When selection is complete,
click on "OK".  The selected sequence(s) are then loaded into the MySQL
data base.  Pull-down menu "Planning Sequence" will be created, which is a 
cascading menu of "sequence names".

"Project->Open ..." will bring up pre-loaded plan sequences for a pre-
defined project, and allow them the be viewed using the "Planning
Sequence" cascading menu.

"Project-Delete ..." will remove a pre-loaded project and its sequences
from view (if being currently displayed), and from the MySQL data base.

"Project->Add Sequence" prompts the user, via the sequence chooser dialog,
to add one or more sequences to the current project, and the MySQL data
base.

"Project->Delete Sequence" prompts the user, via a list dialog, to remove
the selected sequence from the current project, and the MySQL data base.


Plan Sequence Views
===================
The "Planning Sequence" menu expands into the available sequence names.  
Selecting a sequence name brings up two windows.  The first,
"SequenceQuery ...", allows the user to make data base queries over the 
sequence (see below).  The second, "SequenceStepsView", is a histogram 
of the partial plan data base size for each step of the sequence.  

Partial plan views for each step are available by clicking Mouse-Right on 
the desired step in the histogram ("SequenceStepsView").  The histogram 
steps have a "mouse over" pop-up showing the step number, the data base 
size, and the number of transactions.  The key values for tokens, 
constraints, variables, timelines, and slots appear in the appropriate node 
labels.  There are five active views:

Constraint Network View
-----------------------
An incrementally built directed graph of tokens, variables, and constraints.
Because of its complexity, initially only the token nodes are displayed.  
They are "opened" by mouse clicks which lay out the token's variable nodes. 
Clicking on variable nodes "opens" them to show or link to their nearest 
neighbors (constraints or tokens).  Similarly, clicking on constraint nodes 
"opens" their nearest neighbors.  Clicking on an "open" node (bold border), 
"closes" that nodes nearest neighbor nodes/links, provided the link counts
are 1.  Then the node becomes "closed" and has an unbold border.
The active node ("opened" or "closed" by Mouse-Left click) is positioned in
the center of the view after layout.

Temporal Extent View
--------------------
Lays out all predicates on a time scale, with triangles denoting the start 
and end variable values.  The range of extent is shown by a horizontal line.
The extent line and associated triangles are displayed immediately below 
each predicate node.  Downward triangles are start times, upward triangles 
are end times, leftward triangles are -Infinity, and rightward triangles are 
+Infinity.  Clicking Mouse-Right on the view background will pop-up a menu,
one of whose selections is "Set Time Scale Line".  Selecting it will cause a
red vertical time scale line to be drawn.  A Mouse-Right "Set Time Scale Line"
selection at another location will move the time scale line.  Applying a 
Content Specification filter will cause the view to be redrawn with only the 
filtered predicates.

Timeline View
-------------
Lays out the plan's objects, timelines, and slots.  Start/end time intervals
are displayed at slot boundaries.  Applying a Content Specification filter 
will cause the view to be redrawn with only the filtered timelines and slots.
Adjacent slots whose end and start intervals are equal will be drawn abutting 
each other.  Those that are not, will be drawn with a fixed space between them,
and the later slot will have its time interval labels drawn "lower" than
the previous slot, to prevent overlap.  

Token Network View
------------------
Lays out the plan's token relations in directed graphs whose root nodes are the 
"supreme" master tokens.  The Token Network View now is freshly layed out after 
a  Content Spec filter is applied.

Transaction View
----------------
Lists the transactions for this partial plan step.  The information includes the
transaction type and the key of the object on which the transaction was acting.


Token Focus in Views
====================
Token nodes (slot nodes in the Timeline View) in all views (except the
Transaction View), have a Mouse-Right pop-up menu with the possible selection: 
"Set Active Token".  When the "active token" has been set, the other views 
have a "background" Mouse-Right pop-up menu with the possible selection of
"Snap to Active Token".  Making this selection will cause the view
to scroll to a position where the "active token" will be shown,
highlighted, in the approximate center of the view.  A Mouse-Left click
in any view will erase node selection highlighting.  In the Timeline View,
clicking Mouse-Right "Set Active Token" on a slot, will set the overloaded
tokens as "secondary tokens", such that when Mouse-Right "Snap to Active
Token" is invoked in the background of the Constraint Network View or the
Token Network View, these secondary tokens will be given secondary
highlighting (turquoise).  The basic token will have the primary highlighting
color (light green).

In all the partial plan views (except the Transaction View), Mouse-Right on 
the background offers "Find Token by Key" which allows the user to enter a 
token's key and have the view scroll to that token's location.


Content Specification
=====================
The information displayed in the partial plan views may be filtered by
predicate, by timeline, by time interval, and by token keys using the
partial plan's Content Specification dialog.  It is also possible to 
limit the set of valid tokens to only free or slotted tokens, as well 
as the first token on a slot ("Merge tokens").  

Applying single predicate, timeline, and time interval filters results
in only the tokens which match that filter being displayed.  To filter
"in" more than one of the types, use the "OR" combo box selection; to
filter "out" more than one of the types, use the "NOT" check box for
each object type, and the "AND" combo box selection

The token keys filter works thusly: click on either the "require" or 
"exclude" radio button, and then enter the key value in the input slot.  
To include more keys, click on "Add"; to remove keys from a previous 
"Apply Spec" set, click on "Remove".  The "require" or "exclude" 
selections override the "Predicate", "Timeline", and "Time Interval" 
selections, with applied together.

Selections applied from this dialog 
result, internally, in a set of valid tokens, which are used by the 
views to filter their displays.


Querying Sequences
==================
In the "SequenceQuery for <sequence-name>" dialog, select the type of
return values from the left "combo box" -- either "Steps" or 
"Transactions".  From the right "combo box", select the type of query.
This selection may create further data entry and/or "combo boxes",
which will be used to qualify the query.  "Apply Query" will cause the
query to be performed and a window to be created to display the query
results.


Screen Management
=================
The "Window" pull-down menu offers the user the ability to rearrange the
partial plan content spec and view internal windows by "tiling", 
or "cascading".  This menu also provides for the selection of all active
windows.

Note that the Multiple Document Interface (MDI) implementation presents
the user with a line of click-able icons along the bottom of the PlanWorks
frame for all internal windows.
