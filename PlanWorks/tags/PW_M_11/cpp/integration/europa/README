First off, check out the latest version of Europa and build it.

NOTE: The PartialPlanWriter is now integrated with EUROPA.  The planners that are in the EUROPA 
tree are now built with it, with the caveat that you now must set PPW_WRITE_NSTEPS to a non-zero
value to make it write.  

For the moment, there is no makefile to build the PartialPlanWriter
class.  This is in my TODO, but not really important at the moment.
To build the PartialPlanWriter, you must have checked out and built a
reasonably recent version of Europa (cvs co NewPlan; cd NewPlan; make).  
Execute the following commands (it helps to have put the path to Europa in
the $EUROPA_HOME environment variable and the path to PlanWorks in the
$PLANWORKS_HOME environment variable, unless you don't mind typing the
paths or lots of "../"s):

cd PlanWorks/cpp/integration/europa
g++ -c PartialPlanWriter.cc -I$EUROPA_HOME/Includes -I$EUROPA_HOME/ConstraintNetwork -ggdb3 -Wall

The following modifications must be made to your planner's source to
utilize the PartialPlanWriter:
1) #include "PartialPlanWriter.hh"
2) construct the PartialPlanWriter.  It requires two arguments--a pointer
to the TokenNetwork (so do this after the TokenNetwork is constructed) and
a String containing the destination for output.  My construction line
looks like this:
String dest("./");
PartialPlanWriter *planWriter = new PartialPlanWriter(&tokNet, dest); 
3) Register the PartialPlanWriter as a subscriber.  i.e.:

SubscriberId subId(planWriter);
tokNet.getSubscriptionManager().registerSubscriber(subId);

Currently the PartialPlanWriter writes automatically whenever
MessageCollecter::flush() is called and does something.  This
is the notional "plan step" right now.  If you absolutely need
to make sure that the PartialPlanWriter writes out the final
state of your plan, just call planWriter->write() when
planning is complete.

NOTE: If you register the PartialPlanWriter as a subscriber before the
initial plan state is constructed, it will output information about the
process of that construction, which can cause propagation and extra
output, if you happen to be using EUROPA's (the ddl model parser in
particular) output for testing.  To output the initial state, just call
PartialPlanWriter::write() immediately after registering it.

You also must modify the makefile to include the path
to the PartialPlanWriter's header and object file.  For
SimplePlanner, just add
-I$(PLANWORKS_HOME)/cpp/integration/europa
to the DIRFLAG line as well as
$(PLANWORKS_HOME)/cpp/integration/europa/PartialPlanWriter.o
to the OBJECTS line.

Finally, execute
cd $EUROPA_HOME
make simple
and the simplePlan will work as it's supposed to.  

There are two convenience environment variables in the new
PartialPlanWriter:

PPW_WRITE_NSTEPS

This tells the PartialPlanWriter how many actual plan steps to
wait between writing out the data for a partial plan.  From a
PlanWorks point of view, none of the intermediate steps were
actually discrete steps, just part of the transition from the
last written step to the current one. A value of 0 will
prevent the PartialPlanWriter from logging transactions and 
writing at all (and thus incurring the overhead of writing to 
disk).

PPW_WRITE_DEST

You may want to change the destination to which the
PartialPlanWriter writes without having to recompile your
planner.  This variable does precisely that.  It will override
any destination value passed to the PartialPlanWriter
constructor.

PPW_DONT_WRITE

If you don't want the PartialPlanWriter to write when it thinks
it should, set this to a non-zero numeric value.  This will 
disable writing, but not logging.

A note about the new output format:  Every planning sequence
is now output in it's own unique directory with a millisecond
timestamp suffixed to the name.  This number is semi-important
for importing the data into the PlanWorks database, so don't
change it.

Copying Sequence Directory Trees
--------------------------------
'<Sequence-name>1068153263616/sequence' contains the sequence url.
If the tree is copied to another location, the url must be
changed.
