  1. Method:6 - All variable containing nodes: interval tokens and resource transactions
     (rectangles); resources (pinched/peaked rectangles); timelines (forward
     trapezoids); objects (backward trapezoids); and rule instances (ellipses)  appear in
     the Constraint Network View.  Variable nodes ("pinched" rectangles) and constraint
     nodes (left/right pointed rectangles) are linked to the variable containing nodes
     "opened".  Node labels consist of the node name and the node key value.
     Mouse cursor over interval token nodes displays "predicateName ( parameterValues)"
     on the first line, its slot key value on the second line, and
     "Mouse-L: open/close" on the third line.  The second line is absent for the other
     variable containing nodes.  Variable node labels consist of the variable value and 
     the variable key value.  Mouse cursor over variable nodes displays "variableType:
     variableName" on the first line, and "Mouse-L: open/close" on the second line, for
     all variable types except OBJECT_VAR. Mouse cursor over OBJECT_VAR type variable
     nodes displays "variableType" on the first line, "value: <value>" on the second and
     subsequent lines for each of 1 to n objects, and "Mouse-L: open/close" on the last
     line.  Constraint node labels consist of the constraint name and the constraint key
     value.  Mouse cursor over constraint nodes displays "constraintType" on the first 
     line, and "Mouse-L: open/close" on the second line, if the constraint is not unary.
  2. All slotted and free interval token nodes appear in the Temporal Extent View
     as temporal nodes.  Temporal node labels consist of the predicate name and the 
     token key value.  Mouse cursor over a temporal node displays "predicateName(
     parameterValues)", and its slot key value on the second line, if it is a slotted 
     token.  Mouse cursor over start/end interval "triangles" displays their time 
     scale value.  Mouse cursor over a token's duration line displays the duration 
     time interval.
  3. Timeline nodes (colored rectangles), slot nodes (peaked rectangles), and free 
     token nodes (transparent rectangles) appear in the Timeline View.  Timeline 
     node labels consist of the object name, the timeline name, and the timeline
     key value.  Slot node labels consist of the slotted token predicate name, the
     number of tokens on the slot, and the slot key value.  Empty slot labels
     replace the predicate name and number of tokens with "-empty-".  Mouse cursor
     over slot nodes displays the slot's "predicateName( parameterValues)",
     and the second line displays the token keys(s), if it is not an "empty" slot.
     Free token labels consist of the predicate name, and the token key value.  The
     mouse cursor over free token nodes displays the free token's
     "predicateName( parameterValues)".
  4. Interval tokens (slotted and free), resource transactions, and rule instances appear
     as nodes, with interval tokens as "master roots" in the Token Network View.  Node
     labels consist of the name and the key value.  Mouse cursor over interval token nodes 
     displays "predicateName( parameterValues)", and the second line displays its 
     slot key, if the token is slotted.  Mouse cursor over resource transaction nodes 
     displays the transaction name and argument.  The rule instance nodes have no
     mouse over "tool tip text".
  5. Transaction entries appear in the DBTransaction View.  All transaction
     entries have values for TX_KEY, TRANSACTION_NAME, SOURCE, OBJ_KEY, and
     OBJ_NAME.  Entries with TRANSACTION_NAMEs of VARIABLE_* have values for 
     PREDICATE_NAME.  Entries with TRANSACTION_NAMEs of VARIABLE_* and OBJ_NAME = 
     PARAMETER_VAR have values for PARAMETER_NAME.
  6. Method:7 - First all the "step<nn>" windows should be iconified, then shown
     again, and then deleted.
  7. Method:8 - An overview window of the Sequence Steps View should appear.

     Active Views".
  7. On the Sequence Steps View, over another step (s2), select Mouse-Right
     "Open All Views".
  8. On the Sequence Steps View, select Mouse-Right "Step Forward step s2
     Active Views", and "Step Backward step s1 Active Views".

Post-conditions:
  1. Method:1 - The selected view is visible and correct.  The plan step histogram
     element in the SequenceStepsView is highlighted.
  2. Method:2 - The view is replaced with the same view of the next step in the same 
     position with possibly different size.  The plan step histogram element 
     highlighting is on the next step.
  3. Method:3 - The view is replaces with the same view of the step that was 
     originally opened.  The plan step histogram element highlighting is on the 
     original step.
  4. Method:4 - The other partial plan views appear for step s1. 
  5. Method:5 - The six views are replaced with the same views for the next step 
     in the same positions with possibly different sizes. The plan step histogram 
     element highlighting is on the next step.
  6. Method:6 - The six views are replaced with the same views of the previous step 
     in the same positions with possibly different sizes.  The plan step histogram 
     element highlighting is on the previous step.
  7. Method:7 - All partial plan views appear for step s2.
  8. Method:8 - There is a full set of partial plan views at step s1-1, and another
     complete set of views at step s2+1.

pop-up selections.

Pre-conditions:
  1. PlanWorks is running.
  2. The "test1" project is open.
  3. No partial plan views are displayed.

Method:
  1. Display "test-seq-1" Sequence Steps View using menu-bar selection
     "Planning Sequence->test-seq-1".
  2. Display "test-seq-1/step<nn>" Decision View by clicking Mouse-Right 
     on the "step<nn>" element of the "SequenceStepsView of test-seq-1", and 
     selecting "Decision View".
  3. Step the Decision View to a step which has a current decision with choices.
     Open the choice list.
  4. Mouse-Right on the decision node "Object|Resource|Timeline|Token|Variable key=nnn"
     and choose all available view options, one after another.
  5. Mouse-Right on a choice node item and choose all available view options, one
     after another.
  6. Click Mouse-Right on the background, and in turn select "Step Backward All Views" 
     and "Step Forward All Views".

Post-conditions:
  1. Method:1 - The SequenceStepsView of test-seq-1 appears.
  2. Method:2 - The Decision View appears with tree display of the step's decisions,
     the current decision in bold font, highlighted, and scrolled to be viewable.
  3. Method:3 - The current decision choice list should show one of four possible
     choices: Entity ("Entity key=nnn"), Value ("Token key=nnn; activate|merge, etc",
     Domain ("{10 20 30} | [15 25]"), or Close ("Close").
  4. Method:4 - The selected views should open and scroll to the appropriate
     highlighted nodes for the decision key value to be viewed.
  5. Method:5 - The selected views should open and scroll to the appropriate
     highlighted nodes for the choice key value to be viewed.
  6. Method:6 - the view titles will reflect that the views displayed are both the next
     lowest step (backward), or the next highest step (forward).
