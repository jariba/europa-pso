The NDDL implementation provided [here](http://code.google.com/p/europa-pso/source/browse/PLASMA/trunk/examples/UBO) can solve RCPSP problem instances generated by [ProGen/max](http://www.wior.uni-karlsruhe.de/LS_Neumann/Forschung/ProGenMax/?format=normal&lang=en).
Typically, the goal is to minimize total project duration while respecting all constraints. This example can be run with the built-in Solver or with a very effective Local Search algorithm called IFlatIRelax ([Michel, Van Hentenryck 2004](DocReferences.md)) that was enhanced to solve this kind of problems. This is also a good place to see how you can build your own solver on top of EUROPA.

Run the example
```
% cd $EUROPA_HOME/examples/UBO
% ant
```

Click on "Go" in the solver dialog, then run "setupDesktop()" from the BeanShell console, you'll see the resulting schedule for this particular example :
