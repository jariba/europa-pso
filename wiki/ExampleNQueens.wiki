#summary One-sentence summary of this page.

The NDDL implementation provided [source:/PLASMA/trunk/examples/NQueens here] includes a UI where you can click on a chess board to move the the queens around and see the constraint violations that EUROPA computes by moving the mouse over each queen. It also provides a simple Tabu Search solver which briefly illustrates how you can build your own solver on top of EUROPA


Run the example
{{{
% cd $EUROPA_HOME/examples/NQueens
% ant
}}}
or, with the optimized version of EUROPA (it'll run much faster):

{{{
% ant -Dproject.mode=o
}}}

You can move the queens by clicking on the board and look at the constraint violations by moving the mouse over the queens:

You can run a Tabu search solver by going to the "Solver" tab and clicking on the "Solve" button.
The arrows at the bottom will let you move through the history of improving solutions:
