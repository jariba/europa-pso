#summary Peng's notes on cppunit

=== Introduction ===
CppUnit is a C++ unit testing module. It is a derivative of Java unit test module called JUnit. CppUnit was originally written by Michael Feathers. The wikipedia description of unit testing is [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_testing here].

Some advantage of CppUnit over ad-hoc unit testing macros such as asserts are:

 * Object oriented (most desired feature)
 * Centered around unit testing as a concept
 * Standard compiler-like text output
 * Easy implementation and management (with Helper macros)
 * Test registry to reduce recompilation needs


=== Download ===
Download Cppunit 1.12 at
[http://sourceforge.net/project/downloading.php?groupname=cppunit&filename=cppunit-1.12.0.tar.gz&use_mirror=internap here]

Install Cppunit
{{{
1) cd cppunit-1.12.0
2) ./configure (if not working, try ./configure --disable-shared)
3) make
}}}

Try the `Money` example (http://cppunit.sourceforge.net/doc/1.11.6/money_example.html)

=== Trouble shooting ===
in case you encounter the following error "fatal error - unable to remap..." when installing cppunit

To resolve it, do the following things in order:
{{{
1) Quit all cygwin processes 
2) Start ash (<cygroot>\bin\ash.exe) 
3) Execute /usr/bin/rebaseall 
}}}

=== Compilation ===
To compile a cpp unit problem (example.cpp), we need to compile it with the following commands:
{{{
g++ -g -O2 -c -o example.o example.cpp
}}}

Then compile the executable like this:
{{{
g++ -g -O2 -o example.exe example.o -ldl -lcppunit
}}}


=== Run Tests (on cygwin) ===
Suppose we want to run the constraint engine test under cygwin. We should first enter the PLASMA directory:
{{{
cd $PLASMA_HOME/src/PLASMA
}}}

Then we run the following jam command:
{{{
jam -sLIBRARIES=STATIC -sOS=CYGWIN -sNOCYGWIN=TRUE run-ce-module-tests
}}}
