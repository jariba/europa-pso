= EUROPA Documentation =
This page provides in-depth documentation on understanding and using EUROPA. If you don't know where to start, or just want a quick overview of how to use EUROPA, take a look at the [QuickStart EUROPA Quick Start].  You can also find an overview of the EUROPA framework and philosophy at [EuropaBackground Europa Background].

=== Development Tools ===
 * [EmbeddingEUROPA How to embed EUROPA in an application] 
 * [MakeprojectPage makeproject]:  Automatically create all the pieces for a new project.
 * [PSUIDocs PSUI tools] for visualization and debugging include :
     * PSDesktop : A Java app to drive (and visualize) EUROPA interactively.
     * UI Components : Java components that allow you to quickly assemble your own visualization or interactive application on top of EUROPA. Available components include : gantt chart for timelines, resource charts, interactive solver dialog. The list of available components is intended to grow over time. 
 * Low-level debugging:
   * [DebugOutputManagement EUROPA Logging]
   * Timelines
   * The Token Network
   * The Constraint Network
   * Metric Resources
   * Common Debugging Scenarios 

=== EUROPA Components ===
 * API
   * [PSEngine] is the Client API and the recommended way to embed EUROPA into and application.  This interface is also available in Java (we use [http://www.swig.org SWIG] to do the mapping automatically).
