#summary This page provides in-depth documentation on understanding and using EUROPA.

= EUROPA Documentation =
If you don't know where to start, or just want a quick overview of how to use EUROPA, take a look at the [QuickStart EUROPA Quick Start].  You can also find an overview of the EUROPA framework and philosophy at [EuropaBackground Europa Background].

=== Architecture ===

=== Development Tools ===
 * [EmbeddingEUROPA How to embed EUROPA in an application] 
 * [MakeprojectPage makeproject]:  Automatically create all the pieces for a new project.
 * [EclipseIDE Eclipse Plugin (SWT)]:  Edit NDDL, view schema, configure and run solver, and view solution details, all from within your Eclipse IDE.
 * [JavaUI Java UI (Swing)]:  View schema, configure and run solver, interact with EUROPA, and view solution details from a plain Java UI.
 * [PSUIDocs Java PSUI (Swing,deprecated)]: Earlier implementation of Java UI.
 * Low-level debugging:
   * [DebugOutputManagement EUROPA Logging]
   * Timelines
   * The Token Network
   * The Constraint Network
   * Metric Resources
   * Common Debugging Scenarios 

=== EUROPA Components ===
 * API
   * [PSEngine] is the Client API and the recommended way to embed EUROPA into and application.  This interface is also available in Java (we use [http://www.swig.org SWIG] to do the mapping automatically).
   * Listeners
     * Adding a Listener
   * [CwithJava Calling your custom C++ code from Java]
   * Doxygen documentation for all the EUROPA classes can be found [https://babelfish.arc.nasa.gov/trac/europa/doxygen/ here].
