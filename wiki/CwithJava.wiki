#summary Example of accessing custom C++ code from Java.

A new project automatically includes its own module that is loaded into the EUROPA engine and stub C++ files to hold custom code (see [MakeprojectPage makeproject]). How to easily extend EUROPA itself with C++ code is shown [CustomConstraints here].  However, we have also made it easy to access your custom C++ code from Java.  Consider the !ExampleCustomConstraint project [http://code.google.com/p/europa-pso/source/browse/#svn/benchmarks/tags/EUROPA-2.2/ExampleCustomConstraint here], which can be downloaded with:
{{{
svn co http://europa-pso.googlecode.com/svn/benchmarks/tags/EUROPA-2.2/ExampleCustomConstraint ExampleCustomConstraint
}}}

We have added a simple 'Foo' class that is written in C++ and accessed in Java as follows:
 # Define 'Foo' with method 'bar' in !ExampleCustomConstraint.hh.
 # Add the signature to !ExampleCustomConstraint.i so that the method will be swig-wrapped.
 # Call the method from !ExampleCustomConstraint.bsh.

Note that we've also shown the same method called from the C++ side in !ExampleCustomConstraint-Main.cc.
