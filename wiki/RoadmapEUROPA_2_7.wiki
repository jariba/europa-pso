=== Search Support ===
   * Add visualization tool for search tree (see decisions made in compressed format, zoom, etc).
 
=== Architecture enhancements/re-factoring/cleanup ===
 * Drop architectural assumption that Constraint Engine stops computation at first constraint violation
   * Remove this assumption from built-in solver, propagators, etc.
   * Modify Constraint Engine API?
 * Make constraint violation reporting robust : issue 216, issue 173,issue 204,issue 205, and a bunch of A4O tickets.
   * Make sure Timelines can be substituted with Unary resources under the covers so that timeline overload is reported as a violation, not as a flaw
 * Systematically expose listeners through PSEngine
 * Add State resource class

     * PSEngine : issue 219
     * constraint violation reporting : issue 220
 * Add plan comparison to regression tests : issue 50, issue 104
 * Add performance measurements to regression tests and autobuild : issue 64
 * Use [http://valgrind.org Valgrind] to verify sound memory management
 * Set up bitten build for Solaris

=== Documentation ===
 * Improve PSEngine docs :  issue 221
 * Architecture
 * Add mandatory tips & tricks for beginners
