#summary Items to be incorporated in future EUROPA releases

=== Architecture ===
 * Consolidate configuration in a single XML file. Provide simple, internal API to access it.
 * Make PSEngine runtime configuration (what modules to be instanciated, wiring between modules, etc) completely data-driven. This seems to be possible only through the use of dynamic libraries. Find alternatives for static libs.
 * Streamline and cleanup PSEngine interface. make sure all extension points and event notifications are reachable through it.
 * allow EUROPA extensions (constraints, propagators, decision points, etc.) to be written in other languages (java/python)

=== Search Support ===
 * Re-factor Solver, make it easier to extend built-in solver, write solver from scratch or by composition of solvers.
 * Add explicit support for relaxations?
 * Add Dave & Sara's work on domain independent heuristics
 * Add min-perturbation heuristic solver from Dynamic Europa
 * incorporate and expose classical approaches from CP (variable ordering, back-jumping, etc).
 * research :
      * Support for automatic interleaving of multiple solvers
      * Machine learning applications to improve search (see Mark Roberts paper on benchmark problems should be useful here).
      * Mixing classical planning and CP,LS,Math programming search approaches

=== Modeling Language Support ===
 * NDDL
      * provide support for soft constraints (specify penalty values) and violation explanation
      * provide procedural elements for :
          * creating problem instances through iteration, branching, etc.
          * loading data from a database
          * creating/extending/running solvers
          * dumping Plan Database/ Schema information
      * provide API to obtain structural information (predicate relationships, grounded instances, etc) about the model
 * provide full ANML support
 * provide PDDL support : #106
 * provide POCL planner for PDDL/ANML

=== Visualization/Debugging tools ===
 * Provide schema browser : #38
 * Improve gantt chart : #39,#40
 * Improve Solver Dialog : #41

=== Automated Build ===
 * Test with benchmark problems from CP, Scheduling and Planning

=== Documentation ===
 * Improve Solver docs : #127
 * Improve EUROPA extensions docs

=== Bug Fixes ===
