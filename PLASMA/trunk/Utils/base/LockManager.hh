   *and lock checking.  The default implementation does nothing.  There is a second implementation, ThreadedLockManager, that
   *manages actual mutexes.  Currently, lock checking is provided in the Id class, and will error out if an Id is dereferenced without
   *the current thread having a lock.
   *
   *Instantiating the LockManager or ThreadedLockManager classes causes the new instance to be registered as the current LockManager.
