  /**
   * @class ConstraintEngine
   * @brief Base Class from which specific Constraint Engine Framework Instances can be derived.
   * 
   * The ConstraintEngine is the core of the framework for building particular constraint processing
   * components. It defines a public interface which presents a state model, and s small set of operations to
   * query state and take appropriate action. Much of the functionality of the ConstraintEngine is provided by its
   * protected interface and its friends. The responsibilities of this class are:
   * @li Enforce the semantics of the state model. The states are defined by ConstraintEngine::State
   * @li Enforce the propagation control policy i.e. who gets notified, of what, when. And also who gets invoked, when, for what
   * action.
   * @li Enforce the proper relationships between the component classes
   * @li Define and enforce the boundaries for extension and customization
   * 
   * The ConstraintEngine plays the role of
   * mediator between Constraint, ConstrainedVariable, AbstractDomain, VariableChangeListener, and Propagator. As such, it is
   * the central controller for the state of the constraint network and the sle delegator of responsibility for managing
   * state changes. This allows the ConstraintEngine to enforce many relationships and policies that are hard to enforce otherwise.
   * See subsequent sections for further details.
   * The mediation is accomplished (and protected) through private members by all parties and a hub and spoke friendship
   * model. The ConstraintEngine (the hub) is a friend of each spoke, and each spoke is a friend of the ConstraintEngine
   * The Mediation algorithms are also an example of the Template Pattern, since it defines a template for
   * collaboration between components which can be customized be changing the handling of the leaf calls, e.g. canIgnore(),
   * rather than core inner loops.
   *
   * @par Relationships Enforced
   * @li Each spoke component (ConstrainedVariable, Constraint, Propagator) instance belongs to exactly one ConstraintEngine (hub) instance.
   * @li Each Constraint instance belongs to exaclty one Propagator instance.
   * @li There is exactly one Propagator instance which will accept any given Constraint instance.  The criteria for acceptance of a 
   * Constraint by a Propagator is a completely customizable feature of the Propagator class. However, a safety check is conducted 
   * when running under normal compilation which ensures the integrity of the relationship.
   *
   * @par Propagation Policy Constraints Enforced
   * While we may wish to permit a range of policies for scheduling notification and processing or propagation events, the framework
   * must ensure that models for customization and extension in this regard to not cede control so much so that we lose the ability to
   * enforce the semantics of the overall network, or a global policy for scheduling.
   * @li Propagation may only occur when no variable domain is empty.
   * @li Propagation will terminate immediately if a variable domain is emptied. Consequently, there is at most one empty domain
   * possible at a time. This is accomplished since the ConstraintEngine is immediately notified the instant a domain has been emptied and
   * all subsequent calls routed through the ConstraintEngine can be checked for this.
   * @li During propagation, all Propagator instances are executed in prioriy order until quiescence, where priority is based on the
   * order of insertion into the ConstraintEngine. Thus, the configuration of Propagator instances is the primary means of customization
   * of propagation. 
   *
   * @par Extension and Customization
   * @li Implement custom propagator to define agenda management scheme for targetted constraints.
   * @li Implement custom constraints. Constraints may only make restrictions to their domains during propagation. This is enforced
   * by ConstraintEngine as it process events on the domains.
   * @li Implement custom event handling for constraints to propagate messages i.e. Constraint::canIgnore()
   * @li Construct different ConstraintEngine configurations w.r.t Propagators.
   * @see Constraint, ConstrainedVariable, AbstractDomain, VariableChangeListener, Propagator
   * @see "Propagator: A Family of Patterns, Peter H. Feiler, Walter F. Tichy"
