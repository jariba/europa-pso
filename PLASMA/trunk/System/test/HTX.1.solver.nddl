 * This test validates that we are correctly controlling the state choices for

 * 1. If merging is attempted the system will crash. Cannot place temporal constrants on the same timepoints.
 * 2. Activation will be tried but will fail since there is no room to place it.
 * 3. Rejection will be permitted as an option.
