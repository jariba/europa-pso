/** * @page guideoverview Users' Guide Overview * * This guide is split into two major components.  * * @section tutorialoverview Tutorial * * The tutorial begins by introducing the main planning concepts in Europa2. It is important to read this first as it contains * the knowledge required to understand the remainder of the tutorial and the reference guides. * * With the basic concepts introduced, the tutorial works through two examples. The first <i>hellorover</i> example is simple but will familiarize  * you with writing a simple description of an action an agent can perform and a goal to be achieved. We then introduce  * the operation of the automated planner on this problem. With the basics introduced, we move on to a more realistic <i>planetary * rover</i> example similar to the one you encountered in the Quick Start Guide.  This application allows us to detail more on  * the language for describing actions and goals and the operation of the planner. By the end of this tutorial you should be * familiar with Europa2 and capable of building your own models. The reference guides will then assist you with the detailed  * questions you will have.  * *@section casestudies Case Studies * This section describes actual applications of EUROAP2. It emphasis the technical apprach taken and  * details the customizations required. *@section referenceoverview Reference Guides *  *     <ul> *       <li> System architecture.
