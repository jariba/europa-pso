 * @section whatiseuropa Objective
 *
 * EUROPA2 is a fast, flexible, extensible, and resusable technology platform for building planning and scheduling applications for space exploration. Its predecessor, EUROPA, 
 * has been deployed as the core planning technology for a varity of NASA research and mission applications. A notable example is MAPGEN, the ground-based
 * activity planning system for the Mars Exploration Rover (MER) mission. EUROPA2 is reimplementation of EUROPA that is significantly faster and easily exstended through a focus on state-of-the art software enginnering.  
 * 
 * EUROPA2 (Extensible Universal Remote Operations Architecture) is a component-based sofware library for representing and reasoning with plans. It is analogious to 
 * component-based sofware in over areas like CLARATy for robotoics or ILOG for scheduling.  
 *
