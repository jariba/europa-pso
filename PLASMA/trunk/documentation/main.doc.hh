 * @mainpage EUROPA
 * EUROPA is a library for building automated planning applications. The library is structured to allow easy integration, customization and extension. It provides:
 * @li A <b>Plan Database</b> to manage the data associated with plans and planning problems. The database ensures compliance of the plan with the domain model.
 * @li A <b>Planner</b> to solve planning problems in the plan database. The planner automatically finds and fixes flaws in the plan database.
 * @li A set of <b> Application Development Tools</b>. This include a high-level modeling language accompanied by a parser and compiler. It also includes an interactive graphical debugging tool (PlanWorks) for inspection and troubleshooting plans and planners.
 *
 * EUROPA has been used in a wide variety of applications, including:
 * @li <b>MER Tactical Activity Planning</B>. EUROPA is the core planning technology behind MAPGEN, a decision support tool for generating detailed activity plans on a daily basis for the MER robotic mission to Mars.
 * @li <b>On-board Planning and Plan Execution</b>. EUROPA was the core planning technolgoy for deliberative and reactive planning on-board a variety of mobile robots. It has been fielded in the Atacama Desert and was the cornerstone of a recent milestone of human-robotic collaboration for the Collaborative Decision Systems program.
 * @li <b>Mission Simulation</B>. EUROPA was used to simulate a prospective robotic mission (LORAX) to the Antarctic for the purposes of system design evaluation.
 *
 * For your convenience, a <a href="../install_guide/install_guide.pdf">Installation Guide</a> has been prepared to set up an installation and a simple project. A @ref rovertutorial "Simple Sample Applictaion" is described to get an overview of the capabilities of EUROPA. A more comprehensive @ref usersGuide "Users Guide" is also available which covers background material, tutorials, case studies and technical references.

 * EUROPA 2 is a culmination of many years of research, development and deployment of constraint-based planning
 * technology. The precursor to EUROPA was HSTS, designed and developed by Nicola Muscettola. HSTS set out the
 * initial domain description language and essentials of the planning paradigm that became the starting point for
 * EUROPA, under the leadership of Ari Jonsson. Ari's team included Jeremy Frank, Paul Morris and Will Edgington, who all
 * made valuable contributions to the development of EUROPA. EUROPA 2 is a further evolution of this line of work,
 * targeted mainly at making the technology easier to use, more efficient, easier to integrate and easier to extend. The
 * development of EUROPA 2 has been lead by Conor McGann in collaboration with Andrew Bachmann, Tania Bedrax-Weiss, 
 * Patrick Daley, Will Edgington, Jeremy Frank, Michael Iatauro, Peter Jarvis, Ari Jonsson, Sailesh Ramakrishnan and 
 * Will Taylor. Funding for this work has been provided by the NASA Intelligent Systems and Collaborative Decision Systems Programs.
