 * @section acknowledgments Acknowledgments
 * EUROPA 2 is a culmination of many years of research, development and deployment of constraint-based planning
 * technology. The precursor to EUROPA was HSTS, designed and developed by Nicola Muscettola. HSTS set out the
 * initial domain description language and essentials of the planning paradigm that became the starting point for
 * EUROPA, under the leadership of Ari Jonsson. Ari's team included Jeremy Frank, Paul Morris and Will Edgington, who all
 * made valuable contributions to the development of EUROPA. EUROPA 2 is a further evolution of this line of work,
 * targeted mainly at making the technology easier to use, more efficient, easier to integrate and easier to extend. The
 * development of EUROPA 2 has been lead by Conor McGann in collaboration with Andrew Bachmann, Tania Bedrax-Weiss, 
 * Patrick Daley, Will Edgington, Jeremy Frank, Michael Iatauro, Peter Jarvis, Ari Jonsson, Sailesh Ramakrishnan and 
 * Will Taylor. Funding for this work has been provided by the NASA Intelligent Systems and Collaborative Decision Systems Programs.
