EUROPA documentation is now kept on the project wiki pages at:

https://babelfish.arc.nasa.gov/trac/europa/wiki

This directory remains simply for Doxygen related files.  Doxygen is used to
document the code itself; those docs can be viewed by using a web browser to
open:

PLASMA/documentation/html/index.html

NOTE: Please ignored documentation in the deprecated directory - it is years
out of date.
