Warning: This file is totally incomplete.

A: Prerequisites:

1. Jam 2.4 or higher.
2. Java 1.4.2 or higher.
3. gcc 3.3.3 (Though some prior versions are thought to work, only
   this one is tested regularly & automatically).

B: Optional 3rd Party Software:

1. PlanWorks - recommended for visualization and debugging.

C: Getting started:

In this section we provide brief details on how to get up an running
with PLASMA, and give pointers to more detailed documentation to
assist in the process.

1. Building PLASMA. 

See the file in this directory 'BUILDING' for more details.

2. Ensuring the system is working correctly.

Once you have successfully built PLASMA, run 'jam run-all-tests'.
This will build and execute a significant number of module tests.

3. Creating your own project

A script is available to get you started with your own project.  It
will create a directory for your project as a sibling directory to
PLASMA and populate it with a build setup, initial model, initial
state, and a main executable to use a standard PLASMA assembly,
including a planner.  We will illustrate it's use with a sample
project called SampleProject:

	cd PLASMA
	makeproject SampleProject
	cd ../SampleProject
	jam SampleProject

You will observe that an executable is built and executed, resulting
in a plan.  You may know change the model and initial state and simpy
retype 'jam SampleProject' to rebuild as necessary and rerun.
