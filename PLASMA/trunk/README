A: Prerequisites:
1. Jam 2.4 or higher
2. Java 1.4.2 or higher
3. gcc 3.3.3 (Though prior versions are known to work)

B: Optional 3rd Party Software:
1. PlanWorks - recommended for visualization and debugging.

C: Getting started:
In this section we provide brief details on how to get up an running with PLASMA, and give pointers to more detailed documentation to assist in the process.

1. Building PLASMA. 
See the file in this directory 'BUILDING' for more details

2. Ensuring the system is working correctly.
Once you have successfully built PLASMA, type 'jam tests' from the command line. This will build and execute a significant number of module tests. You can also run integrated systems tests by typing 'jam run-nddl-planner-tests' from PLASMA_HOME

3. Creating your own project
A script is available to get you started with your own project. It will create a directory for your project as a sibling of PLASMA and populate it with a build setup, initial model, initial state, and a main executable to use a standard PLASMA assembly, including a planner. We will illustrate it's use with a sample project called SampleProject:

	cd PLASMA
	makeproject SampleProject
	cd ../SampleProject
	jam SampleProject

You will observe that an executable is built and executed, resulting in a plan. You may know change the model and initial state and simpy retype 'jam SampleProject' to rebuild as necessary and rerun.
