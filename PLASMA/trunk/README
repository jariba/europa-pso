Warning: This file is likely still incomplete.  Please report any
issues you have (with this file or any other part of the distribution)
using the GNATS issue reporting system mentioned below.

A: Prerequisites:

1. Jam 2.4 or higher.
2. Java 1.4.2 or higher.
3. gcc 3.3.3 (Though some prior versions are thought to work, only
   this one is tested regularly & automatically).

B: Optional 3rd Party Software:

1. PlanWorks - recommended for visualization and debugging.

C: Getting started:

In this section we provide brief details on how to get up an running
with Europa2 (informally known as PLASMA by the development team), and
give pointers to more detailed documentation to assist in the process.

1. Building Europa2

See the file in this directory 'BUILDING' for more details.

2. Ensuring the system is working correctly.

Once you have successfully built Europa2, run 'jam run-all-tests'.
This will build and execute a significant number of module and system
tests.

3. Creating your own project

A script is available to get you started with your own project.  It
will create a directory for your project as a sibling directory to
PLASMA and populate it with a build setup, initial model, initial
state, and a main executable to use a standard Europa2 assembly,
including a planner.  We will illustrate it's use with a sample
project called SampleProject:

	cd PLASMA
	makeproject SampleProject
	cd ../SampleProject
	jam SampleProject

You will observe that an executable is built and executed, resulting
in a plan.  You may know change the model and initial state and simpy
retype 'jam SampleProject' to rebuild as necessary and rerun.

E. Known Issues

See GNATS reports filed in the PLASMA category under Query at:

http://ic.arc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/gnatsweb.pl?database=ic-gnats

The Europa GNATS category is for the "prequel" project, now referred
to as Europa1 and/or NewPlan (after the CVS repository it is stored
in).

F. Troubleshooting

Please report any issues or problems using "Create" at the GNATS URL
just above.  For crashes, gdb backtraces are very helpful.
