How to setup the automated night build process

Repeat the following for each machine you wish to test on. I recommend Linux, Solaris, and OS-X. Previous machines were token, coprenicus, and irock

1) Setup a sandbox (e.g. ~/night-builds/)

2) copy /PLASMA/System/test/autoubuild to your sandbox

3) run manually with autobuild europa-night-build-results@nx.arc.nasa.gov. You may need to fiddle with some of the hard coded paths in the script to 
   where you have gcc etc installed. 

4) run automatically with the following

  setenv EDITOR emacs
  crontab -e

  In the resultant emacs buffer, enter "00 23 * * * /home/YOU/night-builds/autobuild -p europa-night-build-results@nx.arc.nasa.gov" (without the quotes).

  The night build will run each evening at 11pm on this machine. 

5) If the tests find a problem (a test case fails) then you will need to manually remove the "working" and "PLASMA" directories from your sandbox before the tests can run again.
