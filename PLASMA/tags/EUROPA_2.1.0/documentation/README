EUROPA documentation is now kept on the project wiki pages at:

https://babelfish.arc.nasa.gov/trac/europa/wiki


To generate doxygen documentation, run:

jam documentation

This directory remains simply for Doxygen related files.  Doxygen is used to
document the code itself.  To use these docs requires two steps:

1.  Run 'jam documentation' in this directory.
2.  Use a web browser to view docs by opening:

PLASMA/documentation/html/index.html

NOTE: Please ignored documentation in the deprecated directory - it is years
out of date.
