   * The ConstrainedVariable specifies the semantics of a variable from the perspective of a 
   * ConstraintEngine and a Constraint. The public interface is very restricted, and specifies what can be
   * exposed to a customized Constraint. Much of the functionality of the interface is provided
   * through protected or private members.
   *
   * The ConstrainedVariable is an Abstract Class which must be extended to build a working system.
   * The responsibililties of this class are:
   * @li Ensure that each constrained variable instance is connected to exactly one ConstraintEngine instance.
   * @li Maintains the list of constraints posted on the variable.
   * @li Provides the core connection point for event propagation by connecting a DomainListener
   * from the ConstraintEngine to the domain of the variable. Thus, user changes on a variable will
   * trigger activity in the ConstraintEngine behind the scenes. The connection is guaranteed by the base class, or
   * a failure will occur - see isValid().
   * @see AbstractDomain, Constraint, ConstraintEngine, DomainListener, isValid
