     * @class  DispatchGraph
     * @author Paul H. Morris
     * @brief Specialization of DistanceGraph for dispatching activities 
     * from a Simple Temporal Network 
     * in the case when the timing of external events is not
     * under the full control of agent we have planned for.
     *
     * Efficiency is paramount since we have to do a full propagation
     * from each node.  We use the algorithm of
     * Tsamardinos, Muscettola, Morris in AAAI-98.
     * This is a fairly straight port of the Lisp version (file filter.lisp)
     * used in the RAX experiment.
     *
     * The definition of class Dnode must come before class DispatchGraph
     * so that DispatchGraph::createNode may be defined in the DispatchGraph
     * class definition.
