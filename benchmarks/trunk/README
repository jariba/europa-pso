This directory is intended to hold:

A:  Benchmark problems
----------------------

- various problem domains
- instances from those problem domains
- EUROPA models and solvers to handle those problem domains

In other words, a location to test EUROPA, improve its performance, work on
algorithms and compare EUROPA with state-of-the-art approaches in planning,
scheduling, and constraint satisfaction.

B:  Example EUROPA Customizations
---------------------------------

- advanced examples we don't want to distribute with core EUROPA

a) ExampleCustomConstraint shows how to write your own custom constraint.
b) ExampleStateResource shows how to subclass profiles to get your own behavior, in this case to mimick a unary state resource.
