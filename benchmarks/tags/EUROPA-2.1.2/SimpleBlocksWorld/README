12/05/07:  Experimental nddl to model and solve the Sussman anomaly.

See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sussman_Anomaly

The goal here was to keep things as simple as possible and the model doesn't
allow for a block to be moved from one block to another.  So, blocks can only
be moved to and from the table.

EUROPA does solve this problem, although it takes a suprisingly large number of
steps to do so!
