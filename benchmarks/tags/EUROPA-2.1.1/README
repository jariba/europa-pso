This directory is intended to hold:

- various problem domains
- instances from those problem domains
- EUROPA models and solvers to handle those problem domains

In other words, a location to test EUROPA, improve its performance, work on
algorithms and compare EUROPA with state-of-the-art approaches in planning,
scheduling, and constraint satisfaction.
