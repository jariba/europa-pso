## Intro ##

To take a bit of time each week to expand our knowledge etc, each week at our technical EUROPA meeting, we will try to have:

  * One person suggest a few topics they are interested in learning and presenting at the subsequent meeting, and the group will vote on one topic.
  * One person present the topic that was voted on the week before.

## Presentations ##

| Date | Presenter | Topic |
|:-----|:----------|:------|
| 7/16/08 | Tristan   | paper: Constructing Conflict-Free Schedules in Space and Time, David W. Hildum and Stephen F. Smith, ICAPS 07  |

## Ideas ##

  * D`*`, D`*`-light search
